Feature: Div functionality

  As a user
  I want to be able to click on the div
  And be taken to the correct pages
  So that I can access the content of the pages

  Scenario: Check if all the divs are opening or not
    Given I am on the home page tab
    When I click on the component
    Then I am taken to the component div
